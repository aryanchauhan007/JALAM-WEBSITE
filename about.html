            <h1>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 is to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.  The targets cover all aspects of both the water cycle and sanitation systems, and their achievement is designed to contribute to progress across a range of other SDGs, most notably on health, education, economics and the environment.</h1>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>The United Nations has long been addressing the global crisis caused by insufficient water supply to satisfy basic human needs and growing demands on the world’s water resources to meet human, commercial and agricultural needs.

                The United Nations Water Conference (1977), the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990), the International Conference on Water and the Environment (1992) and the Earth Summit (1992) — all focused on this vital resource. 
                
                The ‘Water for Life’ International Decade for Action 2005-2015 helped around 1.3 billion people in developing countries gain access to safe drinking water and drove progress on sanitation as part of the effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals.
                
                Recent milestone agreements include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, and the 2015 Paris Agreement within the UN Convention Framework on Climate Change.</p>

            <br>
            <h1>"Focus on the customer journey"</h1>
            <p>Contaminated water and a lack of basic sanitation are undermining efforts to end extreme poverty and disease in the world’s poorest countries.

                In 2017, 2 billion people worldwide did not have access to basic sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines. 673 million people still practised open defecation. According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, at least 1.2 billion people worldwide are estimated to drink water that is not protected against contamination from faeces. Even more drink water, which is delivered through a system without adequate protection against sanitary hazards. </p>

    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1>"Develop innovative sanitation technologies that are easy to maintain, affordable, and culturally appropriate
      includes improved toilet systems, composting toilets, and waste recycling systems that can effectively manage human waste while minimizing its environmental impact."</h1>
      <br>
    <p>
     1.  Emphasize affordability: Sanitation technologies that are affordable are more likely to be adopted by low-income communities. This may involve designing systems that require fewer materials or that can be constructed using recycled or locally available materials.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      2. Incorporate behavior change strategies: Changing behavior is often a crucial component of improving sanitation practices. Sanitation technologies that are accompanied by behavior change interventions, such as education campaigns and incentives, can be more effective in promoting long-term behavior change.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      3. Collaborate with local communities and NGO's: Working with local communities is essential to ensure that sanitation technologies are culturally appropriate and meet the specific needs of the community. Engaging community members in the design and implementation of sanitation technologies can also help to increase acceptance and adoption.
